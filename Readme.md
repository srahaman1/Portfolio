Using pgadmin and postgres, through Docker, I have set up a Postgres database to manage and upload datasets into tables and views for manipulation.

Raw data lives in the 'ingestion' folder.

My projects can be found under the 'Projects' Folder:
  - data_engineering-zoomcamp : Datatalk's Zoom DE bootcamp. I have been learning DE tools from this course, ultimately pausing because I saw an opportunity to organize my repo in a user-friendly way
  - python_crash-course: some python scripts regarding my re-learning of python through Eric' Matte's *Python Crash Course* book from No Starch Press.
